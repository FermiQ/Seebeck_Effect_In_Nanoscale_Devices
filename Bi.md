# Bi.f90

## Overview

The `Bi.f90` file contains the `BI` subroutine, which is described as a bisection algorithm component for the `ZEROIN` subroutine. In the context of `ZEROIN` (a root-finding algorithm that combines bisection, secant method, and inverse quadratic interpolation), `BI` is called when a bisection step is chosen. This step typically halves the search interval.

The actual implementation in this file is very simple: it sets `D` and `E` (likely step-related variables in `ZEROIN`) to `XM` (half the current interval length in `ZEROIN`). If `ITAPE` is positive, it also prints "Bisection" to the specified output unit.

## Key Components

*   **SUBROUTINE BI(XM, ITAPE, D, E):**
    *   Performs actions corresponding to a bisection step within a larger root-finding algorithm.
    *   **XM (Input):** Double precision. Represents half the current interval length from the calling routine (`ZEROIN`).
    *   **ITAPE (Input):** Integer. If greater than 0, it's a unit number for writing intermediate output.
    *   **D (Output):** Double precision. Set to the value of `XM`. In `ZEROIN`, `D` is often the proposed change to the current best estimate of the root.
    *   **E (Output):** Double precision. Set to the value of `XM`. In `ZEROIN`, `E` often stores the value of `D` from the previous step, used to control step size choices.

## Important Variables/Constants

*   There are no file-specific important variables or constants beyond the subroutine arguments. The behavior is entirely determined by the inputs from the calling routine (`ZEROIN`).

## Usage Examples

The `BI` subroutine is not intended to be called directly by a user. It is an internal helper routine for `ZEROIN`. `ZEROIN` calls `BI` when its logic decides that a bisection step is the most appropriate next move to narrow down the interval containing a root.

Example call from within `ZEROIN.F90`:
```fortran
! Inside ZEROIN, when a bisection is needed:
! XM is 0.5D0 * (C - B)
! ...
      IF (DABS(E) .LT. TOL1) THEN
         CALL BI (XM, ITAPE, D, E)
      ELSE
         IF (DABS(FA) .LE. DABS(FB)) THEN
            CALL BI (XM, ITAPE, D, E)
! ...
```
In this context, `D` will be set to `XM`, effectively making the next step a bisection of the current interval `[B, C]` in `ZEROIN`.

## Dependencies and Interactions

*   **ZEROIN (SUBROUTINE):** `BI` is exclusively called by the `ZEROIN` subroutine (found in `ZEROIN.F90`). It's an integral part of `ZEROIN`'s hybrid root-finding strategy.
*   **Output (ITAPE):** If `ITAPE > 0`, the subroutine writes the string 'Bisection' to the Fortran unit `ITAPE`. This is for debugging or tracing the behavior of the `ZEROIN` algorithm.
